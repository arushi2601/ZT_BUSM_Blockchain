UAV-UAV Secure Authentication Protocol using Zero Trust Architecture
Design model to implement a secure and robust UAV-UAV communication model using zero trust networks to defend the model against invasive attacks. 
The proposed model consists of two UAVs and a central Ground Station wherein the UAVs communicate and create a secure transfer channel via the Ground Station (GS).
The model is divided into two phases:
1. Registration Phase
2. Authentication Phase- Using mutual TLS certification technique as a method of mutual authentication.
